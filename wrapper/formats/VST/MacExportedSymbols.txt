#  This file contains a list of the symbols that your VST plugin needs to export.
#
#  It's very important that you refer to this file in your linker settings, under
#  the "Exported Symbols File" heading. If you don't specify that these are the 
#  only two symbols exported, the linker will also export all the Obj-C symbols in
#  Juce, and this will create all sorts of dynamic link problems when you have
#  more than one juce-linked module loaded at the same time.
