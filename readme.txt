JUCETICE / JOST v0.5.4 / multi-technology audio host for native plugins on linux

Informations ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JOST is a audio host application for plugins that can be used as plugin itself, or be
compiled as a cross bridge between multiple audio plugin technologies...
It is the first open source multi-technology (internal, native vst, ladspa, dssi) host in
linux. It will mainly host a chain of plugins per instance, publishing jack, alsa and
alsa_seq ports in order to be connected in your main stream flow. It is actually under
heavy development, but it still have some very good features that makes it a first class
host.

Started in middle feb 2007 by Lucio Asnaghi a.k.a. kRAkEn/gORe, is written completely
in C++ (with a bit of C) using the JUCE framework (www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce).

Features:

- modular design with routable audio/midi flows
- audio routing to/from JACK or ALSA
- can sync to MIDI with the start/stop/continue events (i.e. from seq24)
- can load native VST, LADSPA, DSSI plugins
- support for GUI plugins
- midi learn for plugins parameters
- mixer with one channel strip for each plugin and mute-bypass buttons
- audio meter plugin with peak, rms and octave spectrum
- midi sequencer with recording
- midi processors: monitor, filter, controller, pads
- internal disk browser with bookmarks support
- session state load / save with auomatic recall of last session
- colour scheme support

* 32/64 bit jack problems

    Bridging has been disabled until i write a JUCE AudioDevice for using with the bridge
